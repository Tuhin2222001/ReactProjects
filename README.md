About hooks: useRef() , useState() , useEffect 

Real life example i understand :
In a classroom teacher is teaching something , I am taking my personal notes in my notebook this is useRef ,
if I am reading my notes in front of the class then it's useState means ui getting changes and useEffect 
occurs when teacher seen something unimportant i have written in my notes silently and call my parents then its 
an example of useEffect . 

Here in this project 
useEffect is updating the local storage so when i refresh data should still be there .
useRef(): Grabbing the value from the input fields (add button)
useState() : Manage the todo list and updating the ui when task added , deleted , updated 

02.
I have used trim() so that in browser no extra space comes in console.log even if i give some 
space's by mistake .

“I’ve used core JavaScript concepts like functions, map, filter, destructuring, spread operator, 
and DOM access via useRef. I also use trim() for input cleanup, 
conditional rendering, and store/retrieve data using localStorage with JSON methods.”
